# Covid-Stats
An application reporting COVID-19 pandemic, real time statistics and news.

This is a reference application that provides real-time statistics for the global pandemic COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus disease.

The Application includes 'Global Statistics', also stating the last updated time in UTC format, active/closed cases with further description, total positive cases and even total recorded tested cases around the world. A list of Country-wise statistics table mentioning the confirmed, deceased, recovered and other details.

Special focus is given to the INDIA's situation and hence a very comprehensive way of presenting the numbers - including attractive Graph Charts, State-wise statistics table which has clickable tabs that redirect you to the Region-wise statistics table. This is the first application to provide region-wise data for a selected state of INDIA. This data will include state districts and other regions. For India, the last updated time is in IST format, It states total number of cases and total tested as per ICMR. The tables are adjustable, i.e they can be hidden, viewed and even expanded for better view(better in wider screens). the overall view differs as per the device and it is highly responsive to support each of them. For instance there will be four status tabs visible in wider screen devices such as tablets.

Graphs are dynamic and playable - You can press on the color label and the clicked legend will hide, and the graphical view changes as the graph regenerates.

There is one more section dedicated to the latest reliable information from sources like WHO (World Health Organisation) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) countering misinformation.
